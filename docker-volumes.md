# Docker Volumes
# What are Docker Volumes?

* Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the 
  running container.

* The volumes are stored on the host, independent of the container life cycle. This allows users to
  back up data and share file systems between containers easily.

# Getting Started With Docker Volumes

* There are different ways to mount a Docker volume while launching a container. Users can decide
  between the -v and the --mount flags, which are added to the docker run command.

# How to Create a Docker Volume
* To create a Docker Volume use the command:
	* docker volume create <volume_name>

* Docker automatically creates a directory for the volume on the host under the
  /var/lib/docker/volume/ path. You can now mount this volume on a container, ensuring data
  persistence and data sharing among multiple containers.

# List Docker Volumes
* To verify you have successfully created a Docker volume, prompt Docker to list all available volumes with:
	* docker volume list

# Inspecting Docker Volumes
* To see more information about a Docker volume, use the inspect command
	* docker volume inspect <volume_name>


* It lists details of a volume, including its location on the host file (Mountpoint). Everything 
  stored within the data volume can also be found in the directory listed under the mountpoint path



# Mounting a Data Volume
* To mount a data volume to a container add the --mount flag to the docker run command. It adds 
  the volume to the specified container, where it stores the data produced inside the virtual 
  environment.

* To run a container and mount a data volume to it, follow the basic syntax:
	* docker run --mount source=<volume_name>,destination=<path_in_container> <docker_image>


* Replace <path_in_container> with the path where you want to place the data volume in the 
  container. Everything stored in that directory automatically gets saved on the data volume on the
  host as well.

* For example, to launch an Ubuntu container and mount the data volume to it, run:
	* docker run -it --name=example1 --mount source=data,destination=/data ubuntu


* The command instructs Docker to run a container in interactive mode (-it) from the Ubuntu image,
  under the name example1, while mounting the volume data in the /data directory inside the
  container.

* Then, check to verify the volume was successfully mounted by listing the content of the container:
	* ls
