# Docker Volumes
# What are Docker Volumes?

* Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the 
  running container.

* The volumes are stored on the host, independent of the container life cycle. This allows users to
  back up data and share file systems between containers easily.
