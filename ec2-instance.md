# Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a part of Amazon cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services,
 that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.

# Why AWS EC2?
* Why not buy our own stack of servers and work independently? Suppose we are a developer ans want to
  work independently. We buy some servers, we estimated the capacity and the compting power may be
  sufficent. Now, we have to look after the updating of security patches everyday, we have to 
  troubleshoot any problems which might occur at a back-end level in the servers and so on. These are
  all extra chores that we will be doing or maybe we will hire someone else to do these things for us.

* But if we buy an EC2 instance , we do not have to worry about any of these things as it will all be
  managed by Amazon; we just have to focus on our application. That too, at a fraction of a cost that
  we were incurring earlier. Isn't that interesting.

* It is difficult to predict how much computing power one might require for an application which we 
  might have just launched. There can be two scenarios: we may over-estimate the requirement and buy
  stack of servers which may not be of any use or we may under-estimate the usage, which will lead to
  the crashing of our application.
